## Summary
On average, June recorded higher temperatures than December, but apart from the minimum value the quartile markers were fairly similar. One additional query that could show more specific information would be to filter the date by the most recent year, instead of including every year. Another query could be the most recent 3-5 years to have a good sample size.
